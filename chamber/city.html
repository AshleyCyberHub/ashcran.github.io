    <h1 style="margin-top: 20px;">History of Sanger</h1>   
    <p>Sanger, in north central Denton County, was founded in 1886 as a stop on the Santa Fe 
      Railroad. Cattle from the ranches of north Denton County were driven up the old cattle 
      trails through Sanger to northern markets. The cattle industry of the prairies of north 
      Denton County contributed to the founding of the town, and wheat growing contributed 
      substantially to its economy as did the production of oats, maize, millet and cotton. 
      Santa Fe named Sanger in honor of one of its customers, the Sanger family who owned 
      stores in Waco and Dallas. The F.M. Ready family was the first to settle in Sanger in 
      October 1887, the same year as the first engine and caboose arrived.  

      In 1920 the building of a state highway that connected Sanger and Dallas helped 
      compensate for the declining rail business. Cattle and other livestock are raised 
      around Sanger, and there are several horse farms for the breeding and training of 
      registered stock. WalMArt operated a distribution center in Sanger and employs 
      approximately 600 people.  Anchored on the downtown square, Sanger’s downtown 
      businesses continue to thrive.  The population in 1980 was 2,574, an increase of 
      60.6% since 1970. In 1990, the population was 3,508, and the city of Sanger’s 
      current population is approximately 7,000.</p>

<h1>Sanger Mansion getting second chance as wedding and events venue</h1>
<h5>By Jenna Duncan Staff Writer jduncan@dentonrc.com</h5>
<p class="article1">Vacant since the 1980s, the 27,000-square-foot Sanger mansion along Interstate 
  35 is under new ownership and will become a wedding and events venue, Bella Mansions LLC.
  Isabel Ramey will oversee and run the wedding and events venue while her parents, Lina and Kenneth
   Ramey, bought the property. Together, they’re actively meeting with architects to finally finish
    out the building as well as add landscaping to the nine acres of land the mansion sits on.
    “When I walked through it, I had this sad feeling like this house has so much unused potential, 
    o that’s what I’m excited about — giving this project what it deserves,” Isabel Ramey said. “I 
    want to go in and make it something everyone in the community can be extremely proud of.”
    The iconic property was built in the 1980s with the intent of a private residence, but 
    construction halted due to financial issues, said Brad Andrus, executive vice president of 
    Axis Realty Group. The listing was active with the company for years before they found the 
    right buyer, he said.

Originally built by Joseph and Julie Powell, the property was supposed to be a large showplace and 
event space for their passion project, Appaloosa horses. The large mansion was going to be a 
showpiece for them to entertain potential horse buyers and sellers, Andrus said. But due to 
illness and other family matters, work stopped in the mid-1980s.
